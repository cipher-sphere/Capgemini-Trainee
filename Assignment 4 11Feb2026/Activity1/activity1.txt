ACTIVITY 1: Understanding Stack Operations
Subject: Data Structures
Topic: Stacks | Stack Implementation | Basic Stack Problems
 
Objective:
To help students understand the working of Stack data structure and practice Push, Pop, and Peek operations using step-by-step dry run.
Part A: Conceptual Questions
1. Define Stack and explain LIFO principle.
2. What is Stack Overflow and Stack Underflow?
3. Write real-life examples of Stack.
4. What is the time complexity of Push and Pop operations?
Part B: Dry Run Activity
Given a stack of size 5. Perform the following operations step-by-step and show the value of TOP after each operation.
Push(10)
Push(20)
Push(30)
Pop()
Push(40)
Peek()
 
Students must draw stack diagram after each operation.
Part C: Coding Task
Write a Java program to implement Stack using Array. The program should allow user input and perform Push, Pop, and Peek operations.
Part D: Problem Solving Task
Write a program to check whether the given parentheses expression is balanced or not using Stack.
Submission Requirements:
• Handwritten dry run with stack diagram.
• Java program code printout.
• Output screenshot.
• Short conclusion (5 lines).
