Stack in Function Calls (Call Stack):

When a function runs in a program, it is added to a stack.
If that function calls another function, the new one goes on top.
The function that was called last finishes first.
This is why stack follows LIFO (Last In First Out).

Example:
If A calls B and B calls C, then C finishes first, then B, then A.

Stack in Undo/Redo:

When we type something in a text editor, each action is saved in a stack.
If we press Undo, the last action is removed first.
Redo brings back the last removed action.
So stack helps in managing these actions easily.

Stack in Expression Evaluation:

Stack helps in solving math expressions like A + B * C.
It helps in converting expressions from one form to another.
It also helps in checking brackets.

Infix, Prefix, Postfix:

Infix → A + B
Operator is in between.

Prefix → + A B
Operator is at the beginning.

Postfix → A B +
Operator is at the end.
