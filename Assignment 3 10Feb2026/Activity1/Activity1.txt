ACTIVITY 1 – PRACTICAL LEARNING SHEET
Course: Java Fullstack with Angular – Jan 2026
Subject: Problem Solving & Data Structures with Java
Topic: Lists, ArrayList vs LinkedList, Singly Linked List
Duration: 60–90 Minutes
 
1. Objective
• Understand differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.
• Implement List operations practically.
• Manually implement Singly Linked List.
• Improve analytical and problem-solving skills.
2. Part 1 – Concept Analysis (Group Activity)
Instructions: Form groups of 3–4 students and complete the table below.
Feature	ArrayList	LinkedList
Internal Structure		
Access Time Complexity		
Insertion Time Complexity		
Deletion Time Complexity		
Memory Usage		
 
Choose the correct data structure for:
1. Student record system
2. Browser history
3. Online shopping cart
4. Undo/Redo feature
3. Part 2 – Coding Task
Task A – ArrayList Program
Write a Java program to:
• Add 5 student marks.
• Insert a mark at index 2.
• Remove the lowest mark.
• Display the final list.
Task B – LinkedList as Queue
Write a Java program to:
• Simulate ticket booking queue.
• Add 5 customers.
• Remove 2 customers.
• Display remaining queue.
4. Part 3 – Singly Linked List Implementation
Implement the following manually:
• Node class
• insertAtBeginning()
• insertAtEnd()
• traverse()
• search()
Challenge: Reverse the linked list.
5. Viva Questions
1. Why is ArrayList access faster?
2. Why does LinkedList consume more memory?
3. What is time complexity of insertion at beginning in SLL?
4. Difference between singly and doubly linked list?
5. What is RandomAccess interface?
6. Evaluation Criteria (10 Marks)
