ACTIVITY 2 – ADVANCED PROBLEM SOLVING SHEET
Course: Java Fullstack with Angular – Jan 2026
Subject: Problem Solving & Data Structures with Java
Topic: Lists, ArrayList vs LinkedList, Singly Linked List
Duration: 90 Minutes
 
1. Objective
• Apply ArrayList and LinkedList in real-world scenarios.
• Analyze time and space complexity.
• Strengthen manual implementation of Singly Linked List.
• Prepare for coding interviews.
2. Part 1 – Scenario Based Analysis
For each scenario, choose the correct data structure (ArrayList or LinkedList) and justify your answer with time complexity.
1. Real-time chat message storage.
2. Music playlist where songs are frequently reordered.
3. Student database with frequent searching by index.
4. Browser back and forward navigation.
5. Online exam system storing answers sequentially.
3. Part 2 – Coding Challenges
Task A – ArrayList Advanced
Write a Java program to:
• Store 10 numbers.
• Remove all even numbers.
• Find maximum and minimum element.
• Sort in descending order.
• Display final result.
Task B – LinkedList Implementation
Write a program to simulate a hospital queue system:
• Add 5 patients.
• Emergency patient added at first position.
• Remove 2 patients after treatment.
• Display current queue.
4. Part 3 – Singly Linked List (Interview Level)
Implement the following operations manually:
• Insert at specific position.
• Delete by value.
• Count total nodes.
• Find middle element (Slow & Fast pointer).
• Reverse the linked list.
5. Bonus Challenge (For Top Performers)
• Detect loop in linked list (Floyd’s Algorithm).
• Merge two sorted linked lists.
• Remove duplicates from linked list.
6. Viva Questions
1. What is amortized time complexity?
2. Why ArrayList resizing is expensive?
3. How LinkedList stores elements internally?
4. Difference between singly and doubly linked list?
5. What is space complexity of LinkedList?
